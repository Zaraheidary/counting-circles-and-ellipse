##SHAPE DETECTION: CIRCLES&ELLIPSE

##overview
this project focuses on detecting and classifying shapes in images as either circles or ellipses using advanced computer vision techniques.
the implementation utilizes openCv and geometric analysis to differentiate between these shapes, with a particular emphasis
on identifying more convex objects.


##features
preprocessing: enhance image quality for better shape detection.

shape detection: utilize hough transform and contour analysis to identify shapes.

classification: classify detected shapes as circles or ellipses based on geometric properties.

convexity analysis: focus on detecting and classifying more convex shapes.
adjust the detection criteria to prioritize convexity.

visualization: annotate images with detected shapes and their classifications.


##Methods
geometric properties
aspect ratio: 
shapes with an aspect ratio close to 1 are classified as circles,while shapes with a significantly different aspect 
ratio are classified as ellipses.

convexity: objects are analyzed based on their convexity.shapes that are closer to being convex are prioritized.
convex shapes are characterized by having no inward curves.


circularity: a measure of how closely a shape resembles a circle.this is computed using the ratio of the area of the shape
to the area of the circle with the same perimeter.


contour analysis: contour properties are analyzed to distinguish between convex and non-convex shapes, aiding in accurate
classification.
